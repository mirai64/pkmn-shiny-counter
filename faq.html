        <strong>What is this?</strong>
        <p>This is a Shiny Counter for the Pokémon games, meant to be used in order to
            make shiny hunting easier with support for Generation 2 to Generation 9.
            Pokémon is owned by The Pokémon Company, Nintendo, GameFreak, and Creatures Inc.

        <strong>How do I use this?</strong>
        <p>To use this, head over to the Setup tab and select the generation of Pokémon game you're playing on.
            (There is no option for Generation 1 as there were no shinies in Red, Blue, Green and Yellow).</p> 
        <p>Next, select the Hunting method you are planning to use. By default, icons will appear on the Shiny 
            Counter, making it clear which method you are using.</p>
        <p>Next, select the Pokémon you are hunting. By default, this shows a preview of the shiny version of that Pokémon that you can use
            as a reference. (Useful in cases where the shiny version is not immediately recognizable.)</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <strong>What is Binomial Probability?</strong>
        <p>This essentially means that for each Pokémon that you have encountered, the percentage shown
            is the chance you would have had to encounter that shiny Pokémon.
        </p>
        <em>this basically means "number go up, more chance of getting shiny mon"</em>
